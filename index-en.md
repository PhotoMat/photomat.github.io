### Who we are and what we do
> We are group of chemists, physicists and biologists working for the Argentinean National Scientific and Technical Research Council (CONICET) and the National University of Río Cuarto. The Photochemistry and Materials group (PhotoMat) jointly led by [Lorena Gomez](/gomez), [Carlos Chesta](/chesta) and [Rodrigo Palacios](/palacios) has a broad range of interest that converge in the development of new materials, mostly polymeric and nanostructured, with potential application on nanomedicine, environmental remediation and energy conversion. For the synthesis, characterization and application of these materials we frequently employ photophysical and photochemical tools. Given our formal training as photochemists we are frequently interested in understanding basic mechanisms (usually photoinduced) taking place during preparation or application of these novel materials. 

### Development and applications of nanostructured polymers 
#### Therapies against cancer and microorganisms, water decontamination , ultrasensitive sensors
The development of new materials with the ability to solve countless dificulties in actual society is a permanent challenge, since diseases with high mortality rate to environmental issues. Under this circumstances the scientifics can no longer think about only in the design of new materials they also have to think about the impact that structure will have in the desired properties. Thus, it is imperative to internalize existing demands and work closely with professionals from other areas. 

The most outstanding research works that we are carrying on nowadays are focused in the development, study and application of the followed materials:
- Photoactive nanoparticles used in the [treatment against cancer](/cancernanoparticles) and to [eliminate antibiotic-resistant bacteria](/biofilmnanoparticles)
- [Dermatological dressing used in the disinfection and wound healing](/dermatologicaldressing)
- Photoactive nanoparticles used in polymer synthesis with byological applications.
- [Hydrogels as a new modulated drug delivery systems](/hydrogels) 
- [hydrogels as an efficient toolbox in photodynamic inactivation of bovine mastitis pathogens](/bovinemastitis)
- [Ionic gels used in drinking water decontamination](/ionicgels)
- [Nanogels as fluorescent markers and drug delivery systems](/probenanogels)
- [Development of new hybrid materials based on silsesquioxanes with technological applications: photooxidation of organic molecules, adsorption of water pollutants, Oxygen radiometric sensors, etc.](/hybridmaterials)
-[Molecular imprinting nanoparticles used in the detection of analytes of interest (pollutants, hormones, explosives, celular marking, etc.)]

> Our interest for creating new materials with specific applications take us to enhance the undertanding about the basic principles that determinate the formation and relation structure-properties of the same materials. For this purpose our group [develop new advanced optical microscopy techniques](/deyt-en) of molecule/indivual particle that are unique in our country and allow the precise study of nanostructured complex materials. 

> Our research gruop has access to [advanced synthesis equipment and characterization](/equipment) of the developed materials. We also count with a high number of [national and internationals collaborations](/collaborations) that strengthen our work and it allow to our [group members](/integrandes-en.md) to participate in internships at advaced research centers.
